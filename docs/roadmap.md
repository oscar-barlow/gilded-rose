# DONE

As a a Guilded Rose team member,
So that we know when we have to sell an item by,
I want a day-counter that counts down how long we have left to sell it

As a Guilded Rose team member,
So that we know the current quality of an item,
I want items to have quality counter that decreases by one every day

As a Guilded Rose team member,
So that I know when I've really got to shift an item,
I want item quality to decrease by two every day when the sell-by date is past

As a Guilded Rose team member,
So that our system reflects reality,
I never want an item quality to be negative

As a Guilded Rose team member,
To prevent ludicrous over-valuing,
I want the quality of an item never to be more than 50

As a Guilded Rose team member,
To represent special qualities of legendary items,
I don't want their quality or sell-by date to ever decrease
```

## TODO
```
As a Guilded Rose team member,
So that I can see how some products appreciate in quality with time,
I want "Aged Brie" to increase in quality by day.

As a Guilded Rose team member,
To represent extremely time-limited items,
I want backstage passes to rapidly increase in quality as the sell-by date approaches

As a Guilded Rose team member,
To represent extremely time-limited items,
I want backstage passes' quality to decrease to 0 after the sell-by date
